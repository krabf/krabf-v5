title: About
---

Hi, my name is Kush (she/her) and I’m a Cebu-based filmmaker and video editor. I’m currently working at a marketing agency that is based in Singapore. I also help mental health companies create educational videos. I’m heavily inspired by Craig Mod and I hope that one day I’ll be able to afford his membership.  
  
Outside of work I am a self-proclaimed serial hobbyist. Recently I've taken a great interest in brewing coffee at home. I put a lot of time and effort into writing coffee reviews, and I'm working on transferring those to this blog, so please be patient. I love photography as well, and I try to publish my photos online, though I am generally shy about doing this. I have been a Notion Ambassador since November 2020—I create free Notion templates on the side and I hope Notioners find them very useful. On any given day, I watch one or two movies. I am fascinated by technology, especially ethical and useful technologies. I enjoy tinkering with the Internet. The World Wide Web has always fascinated me. I feel as though I grew up on the Internet, and that it has taught me a lot of what I know. Technology has often found ways to pull me into new hobbies.

I am also obsessed with [Fleabag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag).
