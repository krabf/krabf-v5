    <p>Hi, I’m Kush (she/her), I’m a Cebu-based filmmaker and video editor. I create and write short films and collaborate with fellow artists. My thesis film has been 
      exhibited at independent film festivals in the Philippines. I create Notion templates, explore technology, helping brands, publishing thoughts. 
      I happen to love brewing coffee at home—my reviews can be found [here].</p>
